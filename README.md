This project is a web-based application built using the Flask framework.
It enables users to:
- Upload an Image: Users can upload an image file via a web interface.
- Extract Text: The application uses Tesseract OCR to extract text from the uploaded image.
- Text-to-Speech Conversion: The extracted text is converted to speech using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS), and the audio is played directly on the user's system through Pygame.
- Server Controls: Users can stop audio playback or restart the Flask server through the app.
